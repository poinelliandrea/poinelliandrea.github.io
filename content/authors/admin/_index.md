Greetings and welcome to my website! My name is Andrea and I serve as a research assistant in the monetary policy implementation focus group at the Deutsche Bundesbank Research Centre. Additionally, I work as a consultant in the monetary policy assessment section of the directorate general monetary policy at the European Central Bank. Currently, I am pursuing a Doctorate Degree in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt, where my research centers around the transmission and implementation of monetary policy, with a specific focus on money markets and the repo market.
